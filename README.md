## Description

I wanted to create an initial app to test out my skills and collate information that I had learned in the pre-word stage of the EDX Front End Bootcamp, starting 26th September 2023. 

It's an app I can add to as I develop through the course and one I can look back on along the way. 

The app contains my first instance of using HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. 

Please note, at this stage it is not intended to be visually appearling, clearly.
