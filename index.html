  <ul>
    <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it gives the content structure.</li>
    <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
    <li>The <head> Element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
    <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
    <li>The <body> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
    <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>To add style to our webpage, we will use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. </li>
          <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. 
          </li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. Let's explore these and then decide which approach we will use.
          <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading. This is shown in the following code snippet:
            <h1 style="color:rgb(134, 119, 186);">Prework Study Guide</h1>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line.
      <li>However, Git commands are not the same as the bash commands such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks. 
        <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. 
          <Li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.
